# DDDBox

  Three "D" Box

### Features

I want this thing to be configurable by anybody - right now there is a YAML file containing all the configuration which is the screen layouts, icons and colors to choose. In the end everybody should be able to do a lot with it.

Beisdes that there is not much to it - it's just cheaper than a PanelDue, I hope it looks better and it's configurable. By far it does not replace the WebUI and never will - but for me it's better than using my phone.

#### Case

I'll publish the case in a while - right now it's a 2020 V-slot mounted (exchangable mounts) case for a Raspberry 3A+ and a Waveshare A LCD TFT 3,5" 320x480px GPIO touch screen.

## Help needed

If you can and want to help please file issues with sketches of layouts, echancement proposals, icons (I would love some bold icons made just for this)

The piece of UI I implemented is a part of a design my buddy Piotr B made for this.
